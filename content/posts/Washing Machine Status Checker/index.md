This program lets the user know:
- When a cycle finished
- When a cycle **will** finish
- When the door was opened

It does this using a microphone sensor to listen for the dinging noise at the end of a cycle as well as a humidity sensor to measure when the humidity spikes indicating that steam/vapor is coming out of a freshly opened washing machine. This of course is very simple

## Materials
- Arduino Uno R3
- MCP2515 CAN Bus Module
- OBDII Female Port
- Power Supplies
- Jumper Wires

## Wiring
4 LEDs (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow) to represent 4 packet types (ICMP, TCP, UDP, and Other). Any GPIO pins can be used, in this case, GPIO 2, 5, 21, and 23 were used (NodeMCU ESP-12E). The 220 Î© Resistors are optional.
